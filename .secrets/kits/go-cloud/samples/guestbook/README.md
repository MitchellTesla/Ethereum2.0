# Guestbook Sample
Guestbook is a sample application that records visitors' messages, displays a cloud banner, and an administrative message. The main business logic is written in a cloud-agnostic manner using MySQL, the generic blob API, and the generic runtimevar API. All platform-specific code is set up by Wire.

The online tutorial will walk you through how to build, run, and deploy this sample locally, on Google Cloud Platform (GCP), on Amazon Web Servicess (AWS), or on Microsoft Azure.
