# Supported Clients & Binaries

# Intro

Binaries are an integral part of the Ethereum ecosystem. There are many amazing tools (Clef, ZoKrates, Puppeth, ...) that go even beyond the different client implementations (Geth, Prysm, Besu, Nethermind, ...).
However, managing them can be a very complex task. There are no standards for how binaries are distributed and you might find Docker images, binaries hosted on (GitHub, Azure, Bintray, AWS), or even have to build them from source yourself by installing the respective toolchains first and learning about language specific details.
Moreover, important steps such as binary verification with e.g. GPG are often skipped because it is too complex or inconvenient.
Interacting with these binaries, e.g. from a script file when they are running inside a container creates a whole new set of challenges.
The goal of this library is to create a unified interface to download, configure and interact with Ethereum binaries so that it's more about the `what` and less about `how`.

# Installation
```shell
npm install -g ethbinary
```

# Quickstart üöÄ

#### Example: Start Geth 
```shell
ethbinary geth@latest --goerli
```

Will download the latest version of geth and start geth with a connection to the goerli testnet:

# Use in CLI

### Overview

```shell
  USAGE

    ethbinary <subcommand>

  SUBCOMMANDS

    download - Downloads a client                 
    exec     - Executes a command on a client     
    list     - Lists the supported clients        
    start    - Starts a client                    
    version  - Prints the ethbinary version
```

Commands will auto-detect the operating system and download binaries for the correct platform.
All client commands support a shorthand `<client name>@<version>`.
ethbinary supports two special version string: `latest` & `cache`.


### Examples

```shell
ethbinary list //example: returns [ 'besu', 'ewasm', 'geth', 'prysm' ]

ethbinary download geth // will display version selector
ethbinary download geth@1.9.10 // short-hand specifier
ethbinary download geth --clientVersion 1.9.10 // equivalent to above syntax

ethbinary exec geth@latest "version" // the command MUST be one string for the parser to work
ethbinary exec geth@latest "account new" // is auto-attached to terminal so that stdin for password works
ethbinary exec geth --clientVersion latest "account new"

ethbinary start geth // will start latest geth version with mainnet connection (geth default)
ethbinary start geth --goerli
ethbinary start geth@1.9.10 --goerli
```

# Use as Module

### Example Start Client Service
```javascript
const { default: cm } = require('ethbinary') // get the client manager instance
const client = await cm.getClient('geth')
await cm.startClient(client, ['--goerli'])
await cm.stopClient(client)
```

### More Examples

#### [Create Account](examples/create_account.js)

### API

#### ClientInfo

```typescript
interface ClientInfo {
  id: string // generated internal uuid
  type: 'docker' | 'binary'
  state: 'INIT' | 'STARTED' | 'STOPPED' | 'ERROR'
  started: number // timestamp
  stopped: number // timestamp
  binaryPath: string // path to extracted binary, runtime or docker container name
  processId: string // process id for started binaries or container id for docker clients
}
```

#### ClientManager

##### `public async getClientVersions(clientName: string) : Promise<IRelease[]>`

Returns the release list for a client.

##### `public async getClient(clientSpec: string | ClientConfig, options?: DownloadOptions) : Promise<ClientInfo>`

Uses a cached client, or downloads a new / updated one / pulls docker image and returns `ClientInfo`.
If version is `latest` and a newer version than the one on the system exists, it will download the newer version automatically. 
If binary can be extracted from a package it will be extracted and written to `options.cachePath`.
If the client uses a runtime such as Java it will extract all package contents and `binaryPath` will point to the Java runtime.
If the client is distributed as a docker image `binaryPath` will be set to the name of the existing or generated Docker container.

##### `public async startClient(clientId: string | ClientInfo, version: string, flags?: string[], options?: DownloadOptions) : Promise<ClientInfo>`

Uses `getClient` internally but also starts a new child process or container for the client binary.

##### `public async stopClient(clientId: string | ClientInfo,) : Promise<ClientInfo>`

Stops the process(es) and container(s) associated with a client.
Throws if no process is found.

# Use with Docker

Docker is great for isolated environments: each container instance has their own file system, networking, and isolated process tree separate from the host.
This library comes with multiple tools to make interacting with docker easier.


### Clients

`ethbinary` supports the execution of dockerized clients i.e. binaries that are distributed as Docker images.
If a dockerized client is started, the `processId` of the `ClientInfo` object returned will be the respective container id.

### Wrapping Binaries

# Binary Verification

# Extension

Client support is handled through a `ClientConfiguration`.

There are two types of clients: Dockerized and PackagedBinary and each has their own configuration.

### Base Config

```typescript
export interface ClientBaseConfig {
  name: string;
  displayName: string;
  flags?: string[]
}
```

### Packaged Binaries

A `ClientConfiguration` for a `PackagedBinary` client has the form:

```typescript
export interface PackageConfig extends ClientBaseConfig {
  repository: string;
  prefix?: undefined;
  filter?: FilterFunction;
  binaryName?: string;
  publicKey?: string;
}
```

#### repository : `<repo specifier> | url`

`<repo specifier>` specifies the binary hoster with `ethpkg` syntax like `azure:gethstore`, `bintray:hyperledger-org/besu-repo/besu`, `github:ethereum/client`

`url` a fully qualified url to the project / repository

#### prefix : `string`

The `prefix` is a server-side executed filter. Usually implemented as string matching on the file's key or path.
AWS S3: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/ListingKeysHierarchy.html
Azure Blob storage: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/storageservices/list-blobs#uri-parameters

#### filter : `predicate`

Contrary to `prefix`, `filter` specifies a predicate function that is executed client-side. Note that data, which is filtered out client-side, is unnecessarily transferred.
If this can be avoided by using a `prefix` it should be implemented. 

#### binaryName : `string`

The name or relative path of the binary within the package - e.g. 'geth'.
The name is auto-expanded to geth.exe if necessary.

### Dockerized Clients

Are binaries that are distributed as Docker images.

The configuration for a Dockerized client has the following properties:

```typescript
export interface DockerConfig extends ClientBaseConfig {
  dockerimage: string;
  entryPoint?: string;
  service: boolean;
}
```

#### dockerimage : `path | url`
`path` a new image will be created based on the locally available `Dockerfile`

`url` the image is pulled from the registry

#### entryPoint : `path | 'auto'`

`path` similar to `binaryName`, the `entryPoint` helps to locate the binary inside of the docker container.

`'auto'` ethbinary will try to automatically detect the container's entryPoint based on container metadata.

#### service : `true | false`

`true` the binary specified by `entryPoint` is executed to start the service.

`false` the container is started and waits for the implementing client to issue comands via `execute` on the `entryPoint`
