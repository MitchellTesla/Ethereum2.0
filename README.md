# Ξthereum 2.0  ~ MITCHΞLL ~

MITCHΞLL's repository for the Ξthereum Virtual Machine and Network
(developer's can refer to the devLab3 repo for a library of Solidity smart-contracts and reference guides)

Ethereum is the permissionless, non-hierarchical network of computers (nodes) which build and come to consensus on an ever-growing series of "blocks", or batches of transactions, known as the blockchain. 

Please check 'Projects' and repo's for more detailed information on the ETH 2.0 protocol.

This repository is "New" and in the early days of construction for Eth 2.0
