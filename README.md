Ξthereum 2.0
MITCHΞLL's repository for the Ξthereum Virtual Machine and Network

Ethereum is a permissionless, non-hierarchical network of computers (nodes) which build and come to consensus on an ever-growing series of "blocks", or batches of transactions, known as the blockchain. 
Please check 'Projects' for detailed information on the protocol.

This repository is in the early days of construction.
