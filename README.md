# Ξthereum 2.0  ~ MITCHΞLL ~
MITCHΞLL's repository for the Ξthereum Virtual Machine and Network

Ethereum is the permissionless, non-hierarchical network of computers (nodes) which build and come to consensus on an ever-growing series of "blocks", or batches of transactions, known as the blockchain. 

Check 'Projects' and repo's for more detailed information on the ETH 2.0 protocol.
(refer to the DevLab3 repo for more libraries of Solidity smart-contracts and reference guides) 

This repository is in the early days of construction for Eth 2.0
