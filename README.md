Ethereum is a permissionless, non-hierarchical network of computers (nodes) which build and come to consensus on an ever-growing series of "blocks", or batches of transactions, known as the blockchain. Reference: DevLab3 repo for more libraries of Solidity smart-contracts and reference documentation.

# Check 'Projects' for more information on the Ξthereum 2.0 
Notice: (WIP) This repository is under construction for ETH2.0, updates frequently.* May have bugs or issues during construction.
