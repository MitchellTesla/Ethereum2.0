Ethereum has started implementing a series of upgrades called Ethereum 2.0, which includes a transition from proof of work to proof of stake, and aims to increase transaction throughput using sharding.

# Introduction 
Ethereum is a permissionless, non-hierarchical network of computers (nodes) which build and come to consensus on an ever-growing series of "blocks", or batches of transactions, known as the blockchain. 

The platform allows developers to build and operate decentralized applications that users can interact with.  

Decentralized finance (DeFi) applications provide a broad array of financial services without the need for typical financial intermediaries, such as brokerages, exchanges, or banks, allowing cryptocurrency users to borrow against their holdings or lend them out for interest. 

Ethereum also allows for the creation and exchange of NFTs, which are non-interchangeable tokens connected to digital works of art or other real-world items and sold as unique digital property. 

Additionally, many other cryptocurrencies operate as ERC-20 tokens on top of the Ethereum blockchain and have utilized the platform/protocol for initial coin offerings.

In 2016, a hacker exploited a flaw in a third-party project called The DAO and stole $50 million of Ether.  Which marked the beginning of what was known as "The DAO Wars" 

As a result, the Ethereum community voted to hard fork the blockchain to reverse the theft, while Ethereum Classic (ETC) would continue on as the original chain.

###  Notice: 
(xWIP) This repository is an experimental build which is a mass collab of tools, source codes, and dependencies under construction for ETH2.0.** Repo can update frequently* It will have bugs and issues during it's construction as workflows are manually built, tested, and developed.  We recommend utilizing the original source codes, repositories, and branches if you want to fork or clone instead of this repo.
